# Nightfall

This project is a HTML5 browser game. It is a top down shooter which features:

* a day and night cycle
* a dynamic flashlight, rendered via ray casting
* extendable weapons system
* monsters which will attack you during the night phase

It lacks:

* content
* basic animations (except weapons muzzle flash)
* a goal (well ... survive as long as you can but that isn't too hard until you run out of ammo)
* pickups (ammunition and health)
* progress (the game should get harder over time)

In the current state the game is just a basic tech-demo. Feel free to re-use components as you like.
